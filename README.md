**Backend Golang Developer**

---

## Overview

I specialize in building reliable backend systems, focusing on distributed architecture, real-time data processing, and microservices. My primary language is **Go**, and I work extensively with technologies such as **Kafka**, **PostgreSQL**, **gRPC**, and **Docker**. My development process is driven by clean architecture principles, scalability, and performance.
